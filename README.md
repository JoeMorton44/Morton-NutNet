Scripts used for the paper: Genome size influences grassland plant community responses to nutrients across diverse climate and species assemblages of the Northern hemisphere.

"Data Processing and R Script.R" takes initial cover data and genome size data and combines them into one dataset for future analysis. This data is then combined with site climate data to then analyses the effect of nutrient availability on average plant genome size, and the effect of GS on the cover response of species to different nutrient treatments. 

The data for used in this script can be found at:
